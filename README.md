# Boston_Museum_of_Science_Exhbit_Software
Arduino code which was implemented in a museum exhibit for the Boston Museum of Science that taught kids about the duck curve, renewable energy sources and the fundamental need of batteries in a solely renewable energy system.

Code includes the exhbit code that used voltage data from hardwhare to illuminate LEDS as red or green depending on if enough "energy" was being produced.
